Hello, I'm Dmitry.

I have been writing software since [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) times using various programming languages and technologies.
I spent the last 13 years in Java lands and has recently escaped banking industry to use [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
and [Extreme programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) practices.

I often attend tech meetups and other events. Say "hi" if you see me there ðŸ˜€<br/> 
You can find an incomplete list of my past and future presentations [on this page]({% post_url 2019-06-13-public-speaking %}).
