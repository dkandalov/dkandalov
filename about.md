Hello. I am Dmitry.

I have been programming and trying to get better at it since [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) times.
The last 10 years or so I spent in Java and JVM languages land, most recently focusing on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). 

Ignoring the vanity metric of github stars, [code history mining](https://github.com/dkandalov/code-history-mining) and [activity tracker](https://github.com/dkandalov/activity-tracker) are probably the most interesting projects I've done. The bad news is that they're currently dormant. I really hope to get back to them sometime soon. 

For something more exciting and interactive see [L-System Playground](http://dkandalov.github.io/lsystem).
