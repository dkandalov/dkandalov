Hello. I am Dmitry.

I have been programming and trying to get better at it since DOS times.
Last 10 years or so I spent in Java and JVM languages land.

The most exciting project I'm working on is [Code History Miner](http://codehistoryminer.com).
It is CLI and web-server to analyze project code history.
(See also [code mining IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7273) with similar functionality.)

If you bump into me at some conference or meetup in London, please say "hello".
Here is an approximation of what I look in real life.
