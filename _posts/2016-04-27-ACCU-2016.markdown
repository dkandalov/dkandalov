#### Jim Coplien: A Glimpse of Trygve: From Class-oriented Programming to Real OO

https://github.com/jcoplien/trygve

- OO is about objects not classes. Most of the modern "Object Oriented" languages are really "Class Oriented"
- Architecture happens is at **runtime**, classes, etc. is scaffolding for runtime behaviour
- Project value is in delivering use-cases.
- Use-case change rate is usually faster than changes in data.
  Therefore, it doesn't always make sense to combine use-cases and data in classes.
- Model in MVC (and similar patterns) is human **mental model**.
- Micro-services don't necessarily solve the most important problem of semantically breaking down project.

#### Andy Brice: How I Went from C++ Programmer to Running My Own Software Product Company (and you can too)
- Success = idea * (execution^2), i.e. ideas are cheap, execution is crucial
- Narrow product which does only one thing is good because internet is BIG and small niche is big enough.
- Product won't sell itself, examples like Minecraft are outliers. "Word of month" is **very** slow.
- Marketing >> Development
- The biggest challenge is getting noticed
